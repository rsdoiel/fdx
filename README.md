# fdx

_fdx_ is a Golang package for working with XML files produced by many
script writing programs (e.g. [Trelby](http://www.trelby.org/), 
[Amazon Storywriter](https://storywriter.amazon.com), 
[Celtx](https://www.celtx.com/index.html), [Fade In](https://www.fadeinpro.com/) and of course recent versions 
of [Final Draft](https://www.finaldraft.com/)).  This package
also includes a demonstration command line program called [fdx2txt](docs/) which will read an _fdx_ file and render plain text in a [Fountain](https://fountain.io) like format.
